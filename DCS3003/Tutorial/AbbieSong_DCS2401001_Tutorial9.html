<h4 style="color:white;"><U>The story of LanLing</h4></u>

<p style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">

<b><i>Drought and war have turned the once prosperous country into a desert. Under the ruins lies a forgotten ancient country.</b></i>

<br><br>

Few people can imagine how glorious this place was in the past, but he will never forget it. Lanling, once a noble prince, is now a death god lurking in the darkness.

<br><br>

When he was still a child, he saw with his own eyes the imperial cavalry trample the city walls of the capital, and his parents jumped from the tower, sowing the seeds of hatred.

<br><br>

The old man in the mountain took him away and trained him to be a killer. He hid in the darkness.<b><i>Many times he was hired by powerful people to assassinate peace envoys, provoke conflicts, and cleverly stir up fear.</b></i>

<br><br>

However, Lanling, who abandoned his noble status, never gave up the idea of ​​revenge. He had to use this method to express his grief for the past, otherwise the darkness that expanded in his heart would eventually devour him.

<br><br>

What stood in his way was an iron wall - the Great Wall. As long as the Great Wall stood, the empire would not fall easily. The Great Wall was indestructible, and only its guardians could break it.

<br><br>

<b><i>Countless times, Lanling climbed up the high wall to spy on the secrets of the fortress.</b></i>

<br><br>

He knew the names, origins, factions and conflicts of the guards. Lanling had been patiently looking for their fatal weaknesses and adding fuel to the fire when necessary.

<br><br>

The commander fell, the misunderstood traitor fled, and the guards were leaderless. The chaos was short-lived, but a moment was enough. At least, it was so for the barbarians who got the news and were waiting for the opportunity. Their attack turned the Great Wall into a hell of blood and fire.

<br><br>

<b><i>One person against an entire country, how absurd and yet how simple.</b></i>

<br><br>

He repeated this trick, spreading death. Fear grew, and the garrison at the Wall was manipulated. Until one night, the edge of another sword pierced through the darkness.

<br><br>

"It's you, Ghost!"

<br><br>

LanLing smiled.

<br><br>

Well, winning all the time is pretty boring.

<br><br>

<b><i>"The land where the blade cuts is the territory."</b></i>
