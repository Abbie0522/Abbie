<p align=justify>
A <font size=4><b><i>shepherd</font></b></i> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
<br><br>

One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn't find any wolf.
<br><br>

The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here". <font size=4><b><i>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</font></b></i>
<br><br>

After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the filed with the herd of sheep, suddently, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!"</strike>
<br><br>

<font color=#724D97>The farmers <sup>thought</sup> the boy was playing <sub>mischief</sub> again.</font> So, no one paid attention to him and didn't come to his help.
